        <h2>About the Department</h2>
        <p>The Department of Computer Applications at Assam Don Bosco University was formed in the year 2009 with an aim to make contributions toward student
            community in particular and society as a whole by providing a stimulating research environment complemented by quality teaching.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Creating an intense teaching and research environment that moulds individuals into competent professionals who are innovative and committed to meet 
            real world challenges.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To produce competent Computer Science professionals by promoting excellence in education and training.</li>
            <li>To inculcate the spirit of self-sustainability through research, consultancy, development activities and lifelong learning.</li>
            <li>To extend technical expertise to meet real world challenges and play a leading role in technical innovation, creativity and application development.</li>
            <li>To infuse a sense of commitment in individuals for the betterment of the society through technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>The department embodying the University's tradition has a cohesive team of dynamic, dedicated and qualified faculty members and staff. Besides teaching, 
            the faculty members undertake a number of research projects sponsored by various funding agencies and produce regular publications in the areas of Data 
            Science, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, High Performance Computing, Computer Vision, Speech Processing, Network Security etc. 
            Faculty members and students of the department are working with experts from various national and international research organisations. The students are 
            also availing internships and project guidance under such experts.</p>
        <p>The department strives to enable students to acquire knowledge and skills in subjects of Computer Science, to enrich their personal, cognitive, social 
            development, and to equip them for a challenging future. Students have also implemented innovative ideas and presented technical papers at national-level 
            symposiums and conferences and brought laurels. Graduates from the department are equipped to qualify national level exams (e.g. NET, GATE) and most of them 
            are already employed in prestigious institutions and organisations. The department also promotes innovations and entrepreneurship in close co-ordination with 
            the Entrepreneurship Development and Incubation Centre. The Software Engineering Design centre equipped with IBM Software Design tools is another facility
            available in the department.</p>
        <p>The curriculum has been designed keeping in mind the industrial and research needs. Induction of new courses from time to time enables students to keep 
            abreast of latest technological developments. Flexibility in curriculum is provided through electives, seminars, and projects. In addition to these,
            online courses in engineering under the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), an initiative funded by Ministry of Human Resource and
            Development, GoI, and coordinated by the IITs has also been implemented in the department. The department has partnered with IIT Bombay so that students can
            enhance their future prospects by participating in Certification programmes on a range of popular courses in Computer Science through Spoken Tutorial Program
            as MOOCs.</p>
        <p>The department is actively involved in organizing national and international level workshops, seminars, training programmes and conferences for the benefit 
            of students, researchers and faculty members. Invited eminent experts from academia and industries create further opportunities to share knowledge and work 
            on collaborative projects. The department strives to emulate an academic culture that is on par with the best institutions.</p>
        <br>
